This repository provides a concordance of line and stanza numerations employed in the modern editions and studies of John Walton's Middle English translation of Boethius's *Consolatio philosophiae*.
The line-number concordance is a single `csv` file, rendered by GitHub as a [searchable table](https://github.com/icornelius/walton-consolation/blob/main/line-number-concordance.csv).
For each stanza, I supply the following:

1. The continuous line number of the stanza-opening line
1. Continuous stanza number in the EETS edition by Mark Science
1. Science's alternative numbering, by book, section, and stanza
1. The numbering, by book and line, employed by Nicholas Myklebust
1. The continuous stanza number in the partial edition by Karl Sch√ºmmer

Bibliographical details for these sources may be found in my Zotero library under the keyword [`Walton_consolation`](https://www.zotero.org/irc7/tags/Walton_consolation/library).
The same tag supplies other relevant bibliography.
